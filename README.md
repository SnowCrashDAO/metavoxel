MetaVoxel is a Metaverse inspired by Minecraft and constructed by infinite voxels. In MetaVoxel, players can mine and build as much as they want. There are many islands in MetaVoxel, some of which contain large amounts of ores (such as iron, stone, etc.) and some rare treasures (such as gold, diamonds, ancient fossils, etc.). Players can use ore-making tools to build houses, or exchange for other valuable items (of course, they can sell these ores). There are also some islands with a beautiful environment and lots of animals and plants, which are very suitable for players to settle down, set up and operate their own virtual companies.

> When SnowCrash Space 1.0 is released, we will make SnowCrash Space fully open source.
